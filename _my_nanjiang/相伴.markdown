copy-en: "Not far from my house there was a mosque.<br><br>Every Sunday, everyone would leave their donkeys and carts here and then head to the bazaar.<br><br>At the entrance to the mosque, winter jasmine sprouted from the mounds of earth piled up in front, with spectacular yellow flowers in bloom.<br><br>And stuck in the ground were sticks holding ribbons in all different colours.<br><br>After afternoon nap one Sunday, I headed to Aunty Wu’s to find my little cousin, and passed by the mosque on the way.<br><br>The deep blue sky made the mosque shine white.<br><br>And then, out walked the imam, well-kept, wholesome and wise in his appearance, with a Qur’an in hand and black slippers on his feet.<br><br>Waiting for him outside was his wife, with a donkey in tow.<br><br>
She helped him on to the donkey and they set off home. They chatted as she walked with the donkey in hand.<br><br>I walked behind them for a bit. I couldn’t understand what they were saying, but it seemed like family stuff.<br><br>So I watched them walk off into the distance, and turned back towards Aunty Wu’s.<br><br>Later, I heard that the mosque was going to be pulled down. They were going to put a new paved road through there on the way to the bridge being built over the river.<br><br>And then suddenly, overnight one night, the mosque was gone.<br><br>Lots of ancient buildings always disappear in the construction of cities."
copy-zh: "在我家附近的地方有一座清真寺。<br><br>每个礼拜天，这里会聚集满很多空的驴车，人们都把车停在这里，然后徒步去巴扎。<br><br>清真寺门口的土堆上，有迎春花，开着黄灿灿非常显眼的花，还有各种各样的彩色布条的枝干插在土堆上。<br><br>那个周日的下午，睡好午觉，我去小吴阿姨家找弟弟，经过这座清真寺。<br><br>在碧蓝如洗的苍穹下，寺庙变成白色，我看见了里面走出的穿着整洁长相清隽智慧的阿訇。他手中拿着厚厚的古兰经，脚上穿着黑皮拖鞋，走向在路边等他回家的妇人。她手中牵着一头毛驴。<br><br>妇人扶着阿訇坐上毛驴，然后牵着驴，与他边走边聊，一起朝前走。
我跟着他们走了一段，听不懂他们说什么，但感觉就像是在说家常事。<br><br>于是我目送他们远去，转身走向小吴阿姨家。<br><br>后来就听说清真寺要拆。因为在修柏油路，并且不远处的米夏河上要造一座桥。<br><br>一夜之间，那座清真寺就消失了。<br><br>在城市的建设中，总是会消失许多古老的建筑。"
